## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to MPG values include the intercept, the vehicle length, and the ground clearance. Because of this, the slope of the linear model cannot be considered to be zero because these are non-zero variables in the linear regression model. 

Because the intercept has a significant amount of variability, we may need to fine tune our model either by scaling existing variables or adding new variables. As it is right now, the model does not seem to predict MPG very well.
